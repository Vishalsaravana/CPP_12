# BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM

## PROGRAM STATEMENT:

To write the Binary Search Module of Binary Search Algorithm in CPP.

## ALGORITHM:  

1.	Start the program.
2.	Initialize beg = 0 and end = n.
3.	While beg <= end, perform the following:
a.	Calculate the middle index mid = (beg + end) / 2.
b.	If a[mid] == search, print "Element found at position mid + 1", and return 1 (indicating the element was found).
c.	If a[mid] > search, update end = mid - 1 to search the left half.
d.	Otherwise, update beg = mid + 1 to search the right half.
4.	If the loop ends without finding the element, return 0 (indicating the element was not found).
5.	End the program.

## PROGRAM:

```
int BS(int a[], int n, int search){ int beg=0, end=n, mid;

while(beg<=end)
{
mid=(beg+end)/2; if(a[mid]==search)
{
printf("Element found at %d position",mid + 1); return 1;
break;
}
else if(a[mid] >search) end=mid-1;
else
beg=mid+1;
}

return 0;
```

## RESULT:

Thus, the C++ program to write the Binary Search Module of Binary Search Algorithm in CP is created successfully.
